# RNN-TV-Script-Generation
Welcome to Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) project in the Deep learning  Nanodegree! In this project,I generate my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern :)
